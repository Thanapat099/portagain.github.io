                    <p>This year I got a chance to join to educate coding et-robots by using python at KMITL. I got a lot from this camp. Plus a new relationship. <br><br>
                        At first, it was easy to basic python. But I'm struggle in using it on robots. Thanks to my friends and teachers, They gave me a new perspective and useful advice such as how to look carefully at your code and look at the big picture to guide the way you want to do it.</p>

                        <p>I got a new perspective on gamers from this camp. Cause u can be a good developer starting by just playing games. The only problem is my laziness. But if I want to be batter I  must be assiduous.
                            sadly I can't join the competition because of my illness :(

                        My body is quite healthy because of this. Not just physically but mentally too. I learned not to give up. Because nothing over till it over.</p>

                    <p>I love to play games and edit videos, So I combine them. My channel is about my montage(Highlight) from the game I play. You can take a look at my channel from the link below!

                       <p> The challenge is how to be unique and different from other channels. I put a lot of effort into making a video. One of the most important things is a comment from a viewer,
                        Criticism is also important because I use it to improve my content.
